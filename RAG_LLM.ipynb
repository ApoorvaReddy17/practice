A function can be defined\\n\\nas the organized block of reusable code which can be called whenever required.\\n\\nPython allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as\\n\\nfunction. The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. A\\n\\nfunction can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the\\n\\npython program.\\n\\nIn other words, we can say that the collection of functions creates a program. The\\n\\nfunction is also known as procedure or subroutine in other programming languages.\\n\\nPython provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print(). Although, the user\\n\\ncan create its functions which can be called user-defined functions.\\n\\nAdvantage of Functions in Python\\n\\nThere are the following advantages of Python functions.\\n\\no By using functions, we can avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in\\n\\na program.\\n\\no We can call python functions any number of times in a program and from any\\n\\nplace in a program.\\n\\no We can track a large python program easily when it is divided into multiple\\n\\nfunctions.\\n\\no Reusability is the main achievement of python functions.\\n\\no However, Function calling is always overhead in a python program.\\n\\nCreating a function\\n\\nIn python, we can use def keyword to define the function. The syntax to define a\\n\\nfunction in python is given below.\\n\\n1. def my_function():\\n\\n2. function-suite\\n\\n3. return <expression>\\n\\ndef my_function():function-suite return <expression>\\n\\nThe function block is started with the colon (:) and all the same level block\\n\\nstatements remain at the same indentation.\\n\\nA function can accept any number of parameters that must be the same in the\\n\\ndefinition and function calling.\\n\\nFunction calling\\n\\nIn python, a function must be defined before the function calling otherwise the python\\n\\ninterpreter gives an error. Once the function is defined, we can call it from another\\n\\nfunction or the python prompt. To call the function, use the function name followed by\\n\\nthe parentheses.\\n\\nA simple function that prints the message \"Hello Word\" is given below.\\n\\n1. def hello_world():\\n\\n2. print(\"hello world\")\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4. hello_world()\\n\\ndef hello_world():print(\"hello world\")hello_world()\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nhello world\\n\\nParameters in function\\n\\nThe information into the functions can be passed as the parameters. The parameters\\n\\nare specified in the parentheses. We can give any number of parameters, but we\\n\\nhave to separate them with a comma.\\n\\nConsider the following example which contains a function that accepts a string as the\\n\\nparameter and prints it.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. #defining the function\\n\\n2. def func (name):\\n\\n3. print(\"Hi \",name);\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5. #calling the function\\n\\n6. func(\"Ayush\")\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. #python function to calculate the sum of two variables\\n\\n2. #defining the function\\n\\n3. def sum (a,b):\\n\\n4. return a+b;\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6. #taking values from the user\\n\\n7. a = int(input(\"Enter a: \"))\\n\\n8. b = int(input(\"Enter b: \"))\\n\\n9.\\n\\n10. #printing the sum of a and b\\n\\n11. print(\"Sum = \",sum(a,b)) #python function to calculate th#defining the functiondef sum (a,b):return a+b;\\n\\n11. print(\"Sum = \",sum(a,b)) #python function to calculate th#defining the functiondef sum (a,b):return a+b;\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nEnter a: 10\\n\\nEnter b: 20\\n\\nSum = 30\\n\\nCall by reference in Python\\n\\nIn python, all the functions are called by reference, i.e., all the changes made to the\\n\\nreference inside the function revert back to the original value referred by the\\n\\nreference.\\n\\nHowever, there is an exception in the case of mutable objects since the changes\\n\\nmade to the mutable objects like string do not revert to the original string rather, a\\n\\nnew string object is made, and therefore the two different objects are printed.\\n\\nExample 1 Passing Immutable Object (List)\\n\\n1. #defining the function\\n\\n2. def change_list(list1):\\n\\n3. list1.append(20);\\n\\n4. list1.append(30);\\n\\n5. print(\"list inside function = \",list1)\\n\\n6.\\n\\n7. #defining the list\\n\\n8. list1 = [10,30,40,50]\\n\\n9.\\n\\n10. #calling the function\\n\\n11. change_list(list1);\\n\\n12. print(\"list outside function = \",list1);\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nlist inside function = [10, 30, 40, 50, 20, 30]\\n\\nlist outside function = [10, 30, 40, 50, 20, 30]\\n\\nExample 2 Passing Mutable Object (String)\\n\\n1. #defining the function\\n\\n2. def change_string (str):\\n\\n3. str = str + \" Hows you\";\\n\\n4. print(\"printing the string inside function :\",str);\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6. string1 = \"Hi I am there\"\\n\\n7.\\n\\n8. #calling the function\\n\\n9. change_string(string1)\\n\\n10.\\n\\n11. print(\"printing the string outside function :\",string1) #defining the functiondef change_string (str):str = str + \" Hows youprint(\"printing the strin\\n\\n11. print(\"printing the string outside function :\",string1) #defining the functiondef change_string (str):str = str + \" Hows youprint(\"printing the strin\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nprinting the string inside function : Hi I am there Hows you\\n\\nprinting the string outside function : Hi I am there\\n\\nTypes of arguments\\n\\nThere may be several types of arguments which can be passed at the time of function\\n\\ncalling.\\n\\n1. Required arguments\\n\\n2. Keyword arguments\\n\\n3. Default arguments\\n\\n4. Variable-length arguments\\n\\nRequired Arguments\\n\\nTill now, we have learned about function calling in python. However, we can provide the\\n\\narguments at the time of function calling. As far as the required arguments are\\n\\nconcerned, these are the arguments which are required to be passed at the time of\\n\\nfunction calling with the exact match of their positions in the function call and function\\n\\ndefinition. If either of the arguments is not provided in the function call, or the position\\n\\nof the arguments is changed, then the python interpreter will show the error.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. #the argument name is the required argument to the function func\\n\\n2. def func(name):\\n\\n3. message = \"Hi \"+name;\\n\\n4. return message;\\n\\n5. name = input(\"Enter the name?\")\\n\\n6. print(func(name))\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nEnter the name?John\\n\\nHi John\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. #the function simple_interest accepts three arguments and returns the simple interest a\\n\\nccordingly\\n\\n2. def simple_interest(p,t,r):\\n\\n3. return (p*t*r)/100\\n\\n4. p = float(input(\"Enter the principle amount? \"))\\n\\n5. r = float(input(\"Enter the rate of interest? \"))\\n\\n6. t = float(input(\"Enter the time in years? \"))\\n\\n7. print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_interest(p,r,t))\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nEnter the principle amount? 10000\\n\\nEnter the rate of interest? 5\\n\\nEnter the time in years? 2\\n\\nSimple Interest: 1000.0\\n\\nExample 3\\n\\n1. #the function calculate returns the sum of two arguments a and b\\n\\n2. def calculate(a,b):\\n\\n3. return a+b\\n\\n4. calculate(10) # this causes an error as we are missing a required arguments b.\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nTypeError: calculate() missing 1 required positional argument: \\'b\\'\\n\\nKeyword arguments\\n\\nPython allows us to call the function with the keyword arguments. This kind of function\\n\\ncall will enable us to pass the arguments in the random order.\\n\\nThe name of the arguments is treated as the keywords and matched in the function\\n\\ncalling and definition. If the same match is found, the values of the arguments are\\n\\ncopied in the function definition.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. #function func is called with the name and message as the keyword arguments\\n\\n2. def func(name,message):\\n\\n3. print(\"printing the message with\",name,\"and \",message)\\n\\n4. func(name = \"John\",message=\"hello\") #name and message is copied with the values Jo\\n\\nhn and hello respectively\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nprinting the message with John and hello\\n\\nExample 2 providing the values in different order at the calling\\n\\n1. #The function simple_interest(p, t, r) is called with the keyword arguments the order of\\n\\narguments doesn\\'t matter in this case\\n\\n2. def simple_interest(p,t,r):\\n\\n3. return (p*t*r)/100\\n\\n4. print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_interest(t=10,r=10,p=1900))\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nSimple Interest: 1900.0\\n\\nIf we provide the different name of arguments at the time of function call, an error will\\n\\nbe thrown.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 3\\n\\n1. #The function simple_interest(p, t, r) is called with the keyword arguments.\\n\\n2. def simple_interest(p,t,r):\\n\\n3. return (p*t*r)/100\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5. print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_interest(time=10,rate=10,principle=1900)) # doesn\\n\\n\\'t find the exact match of the name of the arguments (keywords)\\n\\n#The function simple_interest(pdef simple_interest(p,t,r): return (p*t*r)/100print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_in\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nTypeError: simple_interest() got an unexpected keyword argument \\'time\\'\\n\\nThe python allows us to provide the mix of the required arguments and keyword\\n\\narguments at the time of function call. However, the required argument must not be\\n\\ngiven after the keyword argument, i.e., once the keyword argument is encountered in\\n\\nthe function call, the following arguments must also be the keyword arguments.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 4\\n\\n1. def func(name1,message,name2):\\n\\n2. print(\"printing the message with\",name1,\",\",message,\",and\",name2)\\n\\n3. func(\"John\",message=\"hello\",name2=\"David\") #the first argument is not the keywor\\n\\nd argument\\n\\ndef func(name1,message,name print(\"printing the message wfunc(\"John\",message=\"hello\",na\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nprinting the message with John , hello ,and David\\n\\nThe following example will cause an error due to an in-proper mix of keyword and\\n\\nrequired arguments being passed in the function call.\\n\\nExample 5\\n\\n1. def func(name1,message,name2):\\n\\n2. print(\"printing the message with\",name1,\",\",message,\",and\",name2)\\n\\n3. func(\"John\",message=\"hello\",\"David\")\\n\\ndef func(name1,message,name print(\"printing the message wfunc(\"John\",message=\"hello\",\"D\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nSyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument\\n\\nDefault Arguments\\n\\nPython allows us to initialize the arguments at the function definition. If the value of\\n\\nany of the argument is not provided at the time of function call, then that argument\\n\\ncan be initialized with the value given in the definition even if the argument is not\\n\\nspecified at the function call.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. def printme(name,age=22):\\n\\n2. print(\"My name is\",name,\"and age is\",age)\\n\\n3. printme(name = \"john\") #the variable age is not passed into the function however th\\n\\ne default value of age is considered in the function\\n\\ndef printme(name,age=22): print(\"My name is\",name,\"andprintme(name = \"john\") #the var\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nMy name is john and age is 22\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. def printme(name,age=22):\\n\\n2. print(\"My name is\",name,\"and age is\",age)\\n\\n3. printme(name = \"john\") #the variable age is not passed into the function however th\\n\\ne default value of age is considered in the function\\n\\n4. printme(age = 10,name=\"David\") #the value of age is overwritten here, 10 will be pr\\n\\ninted as age\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nMy name is john and age is 22\\n\\nMy name is David and age is 10\\n\\nVariable length Arguments\\n\\nIn the large projects, sometimes we may not know the number of arguments to be\\n\\npassed in advance. In such cases, Python provides us the flexibility to provide the\\n\\ncomma separated values which are internally treated as tuples at the function call.\\n\\nHowever, at the function definition, we have to define the variable with * (star) as\\n\\n<variable - name >.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample\\n\\n1. def printme(*names):\\n\\n2. print(\"type of passed argument is \",type(names))\\n\\n3. print(\"printing the passed arguments...\")\\n\\n4. for name in names:\\n\\n5. print(name)\\n\\n6. printme(\"john\",\"David\",\"smith\",\"nick\") def printme(*names): print(\"type of passed argume print(\"printing the passed arg for name in names: print(name)\\n\\n6. printme(\"john\",\"David\",\"smith\",\"nick\") def printme(*names): print(\"type of passed argume print(\"printing the passed arg for name in names: print(name)\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\ntype of passed argument is <class \\'tuple\\'>\\n\\nprinting the passed arguments...\\n\\njohn\\n\\nDavid\\n\\nsmith\\n\\nnick\\n\\nScope of variables\\n\\nThe scopes of the variables depend upon the location where the variable is being\\n\\ndeclared. The variable declared in one part of the program may not be accessible to\\n\\nthe other parts.\\n\\nIn python, the variables are defined with the two types of scopes.\\n\\n1. Global variables\\n\\n2. Local variables\\n\\nThe variable defined outside any function is known to have a global scope whereas\\n\\nthe variable defined inside a function is known to have a local scope.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. def print_message():\\n\\n2. message = \"hello !! I am going to print a message.\" # the variable message is loc\\n\\nal to the function itself\\n\\n3. print(message)\\n\\n4. print_message()\\n\\n5. print(message) # this will cause an error since a local variable cannot be accessible\\n\\nhere.\\n\\ndef print_message(): message = \"hello !! I am going print(message)print_message()print(message) # this will cause\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nhello !! I am going to print a message.\\n\\nFile \"/root/PycharmProjects/PythonTest/Test1.py\", line 5, in\\n\\nprint(message)\\n\\nNameError: name \\'message\\' is not defined\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. def calculate(*args):\\n\\n2. sum=0\\n\\n3. for arg in args:\\n\\n4. sum = sum +arg\\n\\n5. print(\"The sum is\",sum)\\n\\n6. sum=0\\n\\n7. calculate(10,20,30) #60 will be printed as the sum\\n\\n8. print(\"Value of sum outside the function:\",sum) # 0 will be printed\\n\\ndef calculate(*args): sum=0 for arg in args: sum = sum +arg print(\"The sum is\",sum)\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nThe sum is 60\\n\\nValue of sum outside the function: 0\\n\\nASSIGNMENT\\n\\nTOPIC-1 Python Basics Very Short Answer Type Questions(1 mark)\\n\\nQuestion 1.

A function can be defined\\n\\nas the organized block of reusable code which can be called whenever required.\\n\\nPython allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as\\n\\nfunction. The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. A\\n\\nfunction can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the\\n\\npython program.\\n\\nIn other words, we can say that the collection of functions creates a program. The\\n\\nfunction is also known as procedure or subroutine in other programming languages.\\n\\nPython provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print(). Although, the user\\n\\ncan create its functions which can be called user-defined functions.\\n\\nAdvantage of Functions in Python\\n\\nThere are the following advantages of Python functions.\\n\\no By using functions, we can avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in\\n\\na program.\\n\\no We can call python functions any number of times in a program and from any\\n\\nplace in a program.\\n\\no We can track a large python program easily when it is divided into multiple\\n\\nfunctions.\\n\\no Reusability is the main achievement of python functions.\\n\\no However, Function calling is always overhead in a python program.\\n\\nCreating a function\\n\\nIn python, we can use def keyword to define the function. The syntax to define a\\n\\nfunction in python is given below.\\n\\n1. def my_function():\\n\\n2. function-suite\\n\\n3. return <expression>\\n\\ndef my_function():function-suite return <expression>\\n\\nThe function block is started with the colon (:) and all the same level block\\n\\nstatements remain at the same indentation.\\n\\nA function can accept any number of parameters that must be the same in the\\n\\ndefinition and function calling.\\n\\nFunction calling\\n\\nIn python, a function must be defined before the function calling otherwise the python\\n\\ninterpreter gives an error. Once the function is defined, we can call it from another\\n\\nfunction or the python prompt. To call the function, use the function name followed by\\n\\nthe parentheses.\\n\\nA simple function that prints the message \"Hello Word\" is given below.\\n\\n1. def hello_world():\\n\\n2. print(\"hello world\")\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4. hello_world()\\n\\ndef hello_world():print(\"hello world\")hello_world()\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nhello world\\n\\nParameters in function\\n\\nThe information into the functions can be passed as the parameters. The parameters\\n\\nare specified in the parentheses. We can give any number of parameters, but we\\n\\nhave to separate them with a comma.\\n\\nConsider the following example which contains a function that accepts a string as the\\n\\nparameter and prints it.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. #defining the function\\n\\n2. def func (name):\\n\\n3. print(\"Hi \",name);\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5. #calling the function\\n\\n6. func(\"Ayush\")\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. #python function to calculate the sum of two variables\\n\\n2. #defining the function\\n\\n3. def sum (a,b):\\n\\n4. return a+b;\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6. #taking values from the user\\n\\n7. a = int(input(\"Enter a: \"))\\n\\n8. b = int(input(\"Enter b: \"))\\n\\n9.\\n\\n10. #printing the sum of a and b\\n\\n11. print(\"Sum = \",sum(a,b)) #python function to calculate th#defining the functiondef sum (a,b):return a+b;\\n\\n11. print(\"Sum = \",sum(a,b)) #python function to calculate th#defining the functiondef sum (a,b):return a+b;\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nEnter a: 10\\n\\nEnter b: 20\\n\\nSum = 30\\n\\nCall by reference in Python\\n\\nIn python, all the functions are called by reference, i.e., all the changes made to the\\n\\nreference inside the function revert back to the original value referred by the\\n\\nreference.\\n\\nHowever, there is an exception in the case of mutable objects since the changes\\n\\nmade to the mutable objects like string do not revert to the original string rather, a\\n\\nnew string object is made, and therefore the two different objects are printed.\\n\\nExample 1 Passing Immutable Object (List)\\n\\n1. #defining the function\\n\\n2. def change_list(list1):\\n\\n3. list1.append(20);\\n\\n4. list1.append(30);\\n\\n5. print(\"list inside function = \",list1)\\n\\n6.\\n\\n7. #defining the list\\n\\n8. list1 = [10,30,40,50]\\n\\n9.\\n\\n10. #calling the function\\n\\n11. change_list(list1);\\n\\n12. print(\"list outside function = \",list1);\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nlist inside function = [10, 30, 40, 50, 20, 30]\\n\\nlist outside function = [10, 30, 40, 50, 20, 30]\\n\\nExample 2 Passing Mutable Object (String)\\n\\n1. #defining the function\\n\\n2. def change_string (str):\\n\\n3. str = str + \" Hows you\";\\n\\n4. print(\"printing the string inside function :\",str);\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6. string1 = \"Hi I am there\"\\n\\n7.\\n\\n8. #calling the function\\n\\n9. change_string(string1)\\n\\n10.\\n\\n11. print(\"printing the string outside function :\",string1) #defining the functiondef change_string (str):str = str + \" Hows youprint(\"printing the strin\\n\\n11. print(\"printing the string outside function :\",string1) #defining the functiondef change_string (str):str = str + \" Hows youprint(\"printing the strin\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nprinting the string inside function : Hi I am there Hows you\\n\\nprinting the string outside function : Hi I am there\\n\\nTypes of arguments\\n\\nThere may be several types of arguments which can be passed at the time of function\\n\\ncalling.\\n\\n1. Required arguments\\n\\n2. Keyword arguments\\n\\n3. Default arguments\\n\\n4. Variable-length arguments\\n\\nRequired Arguments\\n\\nTill now, we have learned about function calling in python. However, we can provide the\\n\\narguments at the time of function calling. As far as the required arguments are\\n\\nconcerned, these are the arguments which are required to be passed at the time of\\n\\nfunction calling with the exact match of their positions in the function call and function\\n\\ndefinition. If either of the arguments is not provided in the function call, or the position\\n\\nof the arguments is changed, then the python interpreter will show the error.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. #the argument name is the required argument to the function func\\n\\n2. def func(name):\\n\\n3. message = \"Hi \"+name;\\n\\n4. return message;\\n\\n5. name = input(\"Enter the name?\")\\n\\n6. print(func(name))\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nEnter the name?John\\n\\nHi John\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. #the function simple_interest accepts three arguments and returns the simple interest a\\n\\nccordingly\\n\\n2. def simple_interest(p,t,r):\\n\\n3. return (p*t*r)/100\\n\\n4. p = float(input(\"Enter the principle amount? \"))\\n\\n5. r = float(input(\"Enter the rate of interest? \"))\\n\\n6. t = float(input(\"Enter the time in years? \"))\\n\\n7. print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_interest(p,r,t))\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nEnter the principle amount? 10000\\n\\nEnter the rate of interest? 5\\n\\nEnter the time in years? 2\\n\\nSimple Interest: 1000.0\\n\\nExample 3\\n\\n1. #the function calculate returns the sum of two arguments a and b\\n\\n2. def calculate(a,b):\\n\\n3. return a+b\\n\\n4. calculate(10) # this causes an error as we are missing a required arguments b.\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nTypeError: calculate() missing 1 required positional argument: \\'b\\'\\n\\nKeyword arguments\\n\\nPython allows us to call the function with the keyword arguments. This kind of function\\n\\ncall will enable us to pass the arguments in the random order.\\n\\nThe name of the arguments is treated as the keywords and matched in the function\\n\\ncalling and definition. If the same match is found, the values of the arguments are\\n\\ncopied in the function definition.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. #function func is called with the name and message as the keyword arguments\\n\\n2. def func(name,message):\\n\\n3. print(\"printing the message with\",name,\"and \",message)\\n\\n4. func(name = \"John\",message=\"hello\") #name and message is copied with the values Jo\\n\\nhn and hello respectively\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nprinting the message with John and hello\\n\\nExample 2 providing the values in different order at the calling\\n\\n1. #The function simple_interest(p, t, r) is called with the keyword arguments the order of\\n\\narguments doesn\\'t matter in this case\\n\\n2. def simple_interest(p,t,r):\\n\\n3. return (p*t*r)/100\\n\\n4. print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_interest(t=10,r=10,p=1900))\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nSimple Interest: 1900.0\\n\\nIf we provide the different name of arguments at the time of function call, an error will\\n\\nbe thrown.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 3\\n\\n1. #The function simple_interest(p, t, r) is called with the keyword arguments.\\n\\n2. def simple_interest(p,t,r):\\n\\n3. return (p*t*r)/100\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5. print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_interest(time=10,rate=10,principle=1900)) # doesn\\n\\n\\'t find the exact match of the name of the arguments (keywords)\\n\\n#The function simple_interest(pdef simple_interest(p,t,r): return (p*t*r)/100print(\"Simple Interest: \",simple_in\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nTypeError: simple_interest() got an unexpected keyword argument \\'time\\'\\n\\nThe python allows us to provide the mix of the required arguments and keyword\\n\\narguments at the time of function call. However, the required argument must not be\\n\\ngiven after the keyword argument, i.e., once the keyword argument is encountered in\\n\\nthe function call, the following arguments must also be the keyword arguments.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 4\\n\\n1. def func(name1,message,name2):\\n\\n2. print(\"printing the message with\",name1,\",\",message,\",and\",name2)\\n\\n3. func(\"John\",message=\"hello\",name2=\"David\") #the first argument is not the keywor\\n\\nd argument\\n\\ndef func(name1,message,name print(\"printing the message wfunc(\"John\",message=\"hello\",na\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nprinting the message with John , hello ,and David\\n\\nThe following example will cause an error due to an in-proper mix of keyword and\\n\\nrequired arguments being passed in the function call.\\n\\nExample 5\\n\\n1. def func(name1,message,name2):\\n\\n2. print(\"printing the message with\",name1,\",\",message,\",and\",name2)\\n\\n3. func(\"John\",message=\"hello\",\"David\")\\n\\ndef func(name1,message,name print(\"printing the message wfunc(\"John\",message=\"hello\",\"D\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nSyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument\\n\\nDefault Arguments\\n\\nPython allows us to initialize the arguments at the function definition. If the value of\\n\\nany of the argument is not provided at the time of function call, then that argument\\n\\ncan be initialized with the value given in the definition even if the argument is not\\n\\nspecified at the function call.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. def printme(name,age=22):\\n\\n2. print(\"My name is\",name,\"and age is\",age)\\n\\n3. printme(name = \"john\") #the variable age is not passed into the function however th\\n\\ne default value of age is considered in the function\\n\\ndef printme(name,age=22): print(\"My name is\",name,\"andprintme(name = \"john\") #the var\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nMy name is john and age is 22\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. def printme(name,age=22):\\n\\n2. print(\"My name is\",name,\"and age is\",age)\\n\\n3. printme(name = \"john\") #the variable age is not passed into the function however th\\n\\ne default value of age is considered in the function\\n\\n4. printme(age = 10,name=\"David\") #the value of age is overwritten here, 10 will be pr\\n\\ninted as age\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nMy name is john and age is 22\\n\\nMy name is David and age is 10\\n\\nVariable length Arguments\\n\\nIn the large projects, sometimes we may not know the number of arguments to be\\n\\npassed in advance. In such cases, Python provides us the flexibility to provide the\\n\\ncomma separated values which are internally treated as tuples at the function call.\\n\\nHowever, at the function definition, we have to define the variable with * (star) as\\n\\n<variable - name >.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample\\n\\n1. def printme(*names):\\n\\n2. print(\"type of passed argument is \",type(names))\\n\\n3. print(\"printing the passed arguments...\")\\n\\n4. for name in names:\\n\\n5. print(name)\\n\\n6. printme(\"john\",\"David\",\"smith\",\"nick\") def printme(*names): print(\"type of passed argume print(\"printing the passed arg for name in names: print(name)\\n\\n6. printme(\"john\",\"David\",\"smith\",\"nick\") def printme(*names): print(\"type of passed argume print(\"printing the passed arg for name in names: print(name)\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\ntype of passed argument is <class \\'tuple\\'>\\n\\nprinting the passed arguments...\\n\\njohn\\n\\nDavid\\n\\nsmith\\n\\nnick\\n\\nScope of variables\\n\\nThe scopes of the variables depend upon the location where the variable is being\\n\\ndeclared. The variable declared in one part of the program may not be accessible to\\n\\nthe other parts.\\n\\nIn python, the variables are defined with the two types of scopes.\\n\\n1. Global variables\\n\\n2. Local variables\\n\\nThe variable defined outside any function is known to have a global scope whereas\\n\\nthe variable defined inside a function is known to have a local scope.\\n\\nConsider the following example.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n1. def print_message():\\n\\n2. message = \"hello !! I am going to print a message.\" # the variable message is loc\\n\\nal to the function itself\\n\\n3. print(message)\\n\\n4. print_message()\\n\\n5. print(message) # this will cause an error since a local variable cannot be accessible\\n\\nhere.\\n\\ndef print_message(): message = \"hello !! I am going print(message)print_message()print(message) # this will cause\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nhello !! I am going to print a message.\\n\\nFile \"/root/PycharmProjects/PythonTest/Test1.py\", line 5, in\\n\\nprint(message)\\n\\nNameError: name \\'message\\' is not defined\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\n1. def calculate(*args):\\n\\n2. sum=0\\n\\n3. for arg in args:\\n\\n4. sum = sum +arg\\n\\n5. print(\"The sum is\",sum)\\n\\n6. sum=0\\n\\n7. calculate(10,20,30) #60 will be printed as the sum\\n\\n8. print(\"Value of sum outside the function:\",sum) # 0 will be printed\\n\\ndef calculate(*args): sum=0 for arg in args: sum = sum +arg print(\"The sum is\",sum)\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nThe sum is 60\\n\\nValue of sum outside the function: 0\\n\\nASSIGNMENT\\n\\nTOPIC-1 Python Basics Very Short Answer Type Questions(1 mark)\\n\\nQuestion 1.
