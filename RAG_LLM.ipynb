        "Problem: LLMs Are Not Always Up to Date\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and LLaMA are trained on massive datasets, but these datasets are fixed at the time of training.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, LLMs lack real-time awareness and cannot retrieve fresh or evolving information after their last training cut-off date.\n",

        "✅ Solution: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
        "RAG = LLM + External Knowledge Retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG enhances LLMs by integrating them with search or database retrieval systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of relying only on what the model “remembers,” RAG allows the model to fetch relevant documents or data from an external source (e.g., a vector store or search engine) at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 Key Benefits of RAG:\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature\tBenefit\n",
        "Up-to-date responses\tCan pull live or recent information\n",
        "Grounded answers\tReduces hallucinations by referencing external sources\n",
        "Domain adaptation\tCustomize LLMs for specific fields (e.g., legal, medical)\n",
        "Smaller model size possible\tOffloads knowledge to external data\n",
        "📌 Example Use Case:\n",
        "A finance chatbot powered by an LLM with RAG can retrieve the latest stock prices or market news from an API or search engine — even if that information wasn't part of the model's training data.\n",
